/**
 * 
 * - Item 4: Enforce noninstantiability with a private constructor
 *  
 *  Attempting to enforce noninstantiability by making a class abstract does not work.
 *  
 *  A default constructor is generated only if a class contains no explicit constructors, so a class can be
 *	made noninstantiable by including a private constructor.
 *
 * As a side effect, this idiom also prevents the class from being subclassed. All 
 * constructors must invoke a superclass constructor, explicitly or implicitly, and a
 * subclass would have no accessible superclass constructor to invoke.
 *
