/**
 * 
 * One advantage of the static factory approach is that it gives you the
 * flexibility to change your mind about whether the class is a singleton
 * without changing its API.
 * 
 * A second advantage is that you can write a generic singleton factory if your
 * application requires it (Item 30).
 *
 * A final advantage of using a static factory is that a method reference can be
 * used as a supplier, for example Elvis::instance is a Supplier<Elvis>.
 * 
 * Unless one of these advantages is relevant, the public field approach is
 * preferable.
