/**
 * Item 8: Avoid finalizers and cleaners
 * 
 * Finalizers are unpredictable, often dangerous, and generally unnecessary. The
 * Java 9 replacement for finalizers is cleaners. Cleaners are less dangerous
 * than finalizers, but still unpredictable, slow, and generally unnecessary.
 *
 * You should never do anything time-critical in a finalizer or cleaner.
 * 
 * You should never depend on a finalizer or cleaner to update persistent state.
 * 
 * There is a severe performance penalty for using finalizers and cleaners.The
 * time to create a simple AutoCloseable object, to close it using
 * try-with-resources, and to have the garbage collector reclaim it is about 12
 * ns. Using a finalizer instead increases the time to 550 ns.
 * 
 * Finalizers have a serious security problem: they open your class up to
 * finalizer attacks. - Throwing an exception from a constructor should be
 * sufficient to prevent an object from coming into existence; in the presence
 * of finalizers, it is not.
 *
 * To protect nonfinal classes from finalizer attacks, write a final finalize
 * method that does nothing.
 *
