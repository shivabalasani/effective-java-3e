 * 
 * Item 17: Minimize mutability
 * 
 * An immutable class is simply a class whose instances cannot be modified. All
 * of the information contained in each instance is fixed for the lifetime of
 * the object, so no changes can ever be observed. The Java platform libraries
 * contain many immutable classes, including String, the boxed primitive
 * classes, and BigInteger and BigDecimal. There are many good reasons for this:
 * Immutable classes are easier to design, implement, and use than mutable
 * classes. They are less prone to error and are more secure. To make a class
 * immutable, follow these five rules:
 * 
 * 1. Don’t provide methods that modify the object’s state (known as mutators).
 * 
 * 2. Ensure that the class can’t be extended. Preventing subclassing is
 * generally accomplished by making the class final, but there is an alternative
 * 
 * 3. Make all fields final.
 * 
 * 4. Make all fields private.
 * 
 * 5. Ensure exclusive access to any mutable components.
 * 
 * Immutable objects are simple. An immutable object can be in exactly one
 * state, the state in which it was created.Immutable objects are inherently
 * thread-safe; they require no synchronization. Immutable objects can be shared
 * freely.
 * 
 * Not only can you share immutable objects, but they can share their
 * internals.Immutable objects make great building blocks for other objects,
 * whether mutable or immutable.Immutable objects provide failure atomicity for
 * free (Item 76).The major disadvantage of immutable classes is that they
 * require a separate object for each distinct value.
 *
 * String class, whose mutable companion is StringBuilder (and its obsolete
 * predecessor, StringBuffer).
 * 
 * To guarantee immutability, a class must not permit itself to be subclassed.
 * This can be done by making the class final, but there is another, more
 * flexible alternative. Instead of making an immutable class final, you can
 * make all of its constructors private or package-private and add public static
 * factories in place of the public constructors (Item 1).
 * 
 * To summarize, resist the urge to write a setter for every getter. Classes
 * should be immutable unless there’s a very good reason to make them
 * mutable.There are some classes for which immutability is impractical. If a
 * class cannot be made immutable, limit its mutability as much as possible.
 * Declare every field private final unless there’s a good reason to do
 * otherwise. Constructors should create fully initialized objects with all of
 * their invariants established.
