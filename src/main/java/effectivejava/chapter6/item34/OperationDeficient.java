/**
 * 
 * This code works, but it isn’t very pretty. It won’t compile without the throw
 * statement because the end of the method is technically reachable, even though
 * it will never be reached [JLS, 14.21]. Worse, the code is fragile. If you add
 * a new enum constant but forget to add a corresponding case to the switch, the
 * enum will still compile, but it will fail at runtime when you try to apply
 * the new operation.
