 * This code is undeniably concise, but it is dangerous from a maintenance
 * perspective. Suppose you add an element to the enum, perhaps a special value
 * to represent a vacation day, but forget to add a corresponding case to the
 * switch statement. The program will still compile, but the pay method will
 * silently pay the worker the same amount for a vacation day as for an ordinary
 * weekday.
