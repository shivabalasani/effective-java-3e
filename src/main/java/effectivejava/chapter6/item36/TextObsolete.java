/**
 * 
 * If the elements of an enumerated type are used primarily in sets, it is
 * traditional to use the int enum pattern (Item 34), assigning a different
 * power of 2 to each constant:
 * 
 * The bit field representation also lets you perform set operations such as
 * union and intersection efficiently using bitwise arithmetic. But bit fields
 * have all the disadvantages of int enum constants and more. It is even harder
 * to interpret a bit field than a simple int enum constant when it is printed
 * as a number. There is no easy way to iterate over all of the elements
 * represented by a bit field. Finally, you have to predict the maximum number
 * of bits you’ll ever need at the time you’re writing the API and choose a type
 * for the bit field (typically int or long) accordingly. Once you’ve picked a
 * type, you can’t exceed its width (32 or 64 bits) without changing the API.
