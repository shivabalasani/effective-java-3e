/**
 * 
 * Item 68: Adhere to generally accepted naming conventions.
 * 
 * The Java platform has a well-established set of naming conventions, many of
 * which are contained in The Java Language Specification [JLS, 6.1]. Loosely
 * speaking, naming conventions fall into two categories: typographical and
 * grammatical.
 * 
 * There are only a handful of typographical naming conventions, covering
 * packages, classes, interfaces, methods, fields, and type variables. You
 * should rarely violate them and never without a very good reason. If an API
 * violates these conventions, it may be difficult to use. If an implementation
 * violates them, it may be difficult to maintain. In both cases, violations
 * have the potential to confuse and irritate other programmers who work with
 * the code and can cause faulty assumptions that lead to errors.
